# Sensational Buoys Workshop
## citizens sensing and urban waters

## Introduction
The workshop Sensational Buoys aims to explore the intersection between citizen sensing, toyification and urban waters. 
The workshop is dedicated to the design and realisation of “sensational buoys”: small floating devices equipped with simple sensors and with a playful appearance. The buoys are playful devices to sense and visualize data about urban waters and are intended to raise awareness about the importance of monitoring our environment.
