# Sensational Buoys Workshop
## citizens sensing and urban waters

MAB - 24-29 June 2021

https://sensational-buoys.github.io/workshop-description/

## Introduction
The workshop Sensational Buoys aims to explore the intersection between citizen sensing, toyification and urban waters. 
The workshop is dedicated to the design and realisation of “sensational buoys”: small floating devices equipped with simple sensors and with a playful appearance. The buoys are playful devices to sense and visualize data about urban waters and are intended to raise awareness about the importance of monitoring our environment. 

NB Previous experience with coding and/or electronics is not required.

## Citizens sensing and toyification
Citizen sensing means redistributing the power and ability of using sensors and monitoring our environment to citizens and communities. It is a way to promote awareness about the environment we live in and can be an empowerment tool fostering discussion and inspiring citizens to take action. 
Toyification is a subset of gamification: the attempt to use toys and toy-like objects to support creativity, curiosity and exploration. The sensational buoys, then, will be characterised by a toy-like aesthetics as a way to make them more enticing, so that they can involve participants and passersby in the activity and draw attention to the project.

The workshop will be divided in two parts: one dedicated to the speculative, collaborative design of Sensational Buoys and one dedicated to the realisation and testing.
Participants can freely choose to participate only in one of the two parts of the workshop, provided they register their participation at the following link: https://forms.gle/V1c1xdUXgrsj8Nnh8 

## Project

### First part
Speculative design Saturday 26/Jun 15:00-18:00 CET
The first part of the workshop will be dedicated to a speculative exploration of how sensational buoys can be constructed and used. It will be discussed how citizen sensing can be applied to monitoring urban waters. 
The participants will work in groups and engage in activities of participatory speculative design where they will be allowed to experiment and create in a free way. A final discussion and presentation of the different projects will close the first day. 

#### Materials
Participants are invited to prepare some materials for low-fi prototyping (such as cardboard, drawing materials, toys etc.). 

### Second part
Create your buoy! Sunday 27/Jun 15:00-18:00 CET
The second part of the workshop will be dedicated to the realisation of some Sensational Buoys made of recycled and craft materials and of a MicroBit board. The participants will create floating devices able to measure temperature near the water surface and display the collected information. The Sensational Buoys are not meant to collect scientifically accurate data, but to introduce the participants to the basics of citizen sensing in the urban water environment.
The participants will learn to program the microcontroller that has a built-in sensor and led matrix. Accordingly to the available craft material, they will create a floating vessel to house (or fit?) a toy figure and the microcontroller.

#### Materials
In order to be able to actively participate to the second day, the participants will be asked to buy the following materials:
- MicroBit Go bundle (v1 or v2)
- Craft material to make the floating part of the buoy: plastic bottles with cap, waterproof recipients, popsicle sticks, wooden dowels and similar.
- Tools and material to assemble the Sensational Buoy like scissors, hot glue, glue, tape, string, elastic band.
- A toy figure of an appropriate size like a Playmobil, Lego, or similar.

## “Sensational Award” 
At the end of the workshop, the participants will vote for the most interesting, curious and fun Buoy. The makers will receive the symbolical “Sensational Award” for their work and design.

## Procedures for signing up
Participants will be able to sign up for the workshop until the 25th of May. In the sign-up procedure they will be asked some basic information (name, email, Level of proficiency with coding and/or electronics) as well as to indicate in which parts of the workshop they intend to participate. It is possible to participate only in one of the two parts, but participants planning to attend both will be given precedence.

## Workshop length
Six hours in total, three for each day of the workshop.

## Schedule 
First part: Speculative design Saturday 26/June/2021 15:00-18:00 CET
Second part: Create your buoy! Sunday 27/June/2021 15:00-18:00 CET
