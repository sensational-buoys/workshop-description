# Sensational Buoys: citizens sensing and urban waters

26-27 June 2021

Media Architecture Biennale - [mab20.org](http://mab20.org)

The workshop Sensational Buoys aims to explore the intersection between citizen sensing, toyification and monitoring urban waters. The workshop is dedicated to the design and realisation of “Sensational Buoys”: small floating devices equipped with simple sensors and having a playful appearance. The buoys are playful devices to sense and visualize data about urban waters and are intended to raise awareness about the importance of monitoring our environment.
